                        This project focuses on the iconic characters from well-known films, seeking relevant audiovisual material for secondary editing and creative purposes.
                         I have chosen Scarlet Witch, Wanda Maximoff as the subject for my secondary creation.

                        The Scarlet Witch is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
                        Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The X-Men #4 in March 1964, in the Silver Age of Comic Books.

                    <p>
                        Originally described as having the power to alter probability, the Scarlet Witch evolved into a powerful sorceress by the 1980s. Over time, she has learned to tap into immense magical forces, allowing her to alter reality itself.
                        She is widely recognized as one of Marvel's most powerful heroes.
