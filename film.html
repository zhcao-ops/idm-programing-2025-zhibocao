                <h2>FIGHTBOYS</h2>
                <p>
                    The positioning of this film is primarily focused on campus, 
                    action, science fiction, and drama. The main content narrates 
                    the story of Jack, who feels listless every day, with his life, 
                    studies, and interpersonal relationships in disarray, relying 
                    solely on games to distract himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everything begins to change after he meets Mike. The teacher Mike 
                    introduces Jack to an underground organization on campus - the Fight 
                    Club. Jack trains hard there, defeating one opponent after another, 
                    ultimately overcoming the demons that haunt him, as well as 
                    conquering his own inner lethargy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conclusion reveals that Mike is actually another persona of 
                    Jack, and Jack himself is the leader. The entire process is a 
                    gradual reconciliation with oneself.

                <h2>CREATIVE IDEA</h2>
                <p>
                    The focus of this film is an underground fighting club located 
                    indoors. To create this atmosphere, we chose to shoot at night, 
                    and the selection of a dormitory was made to emphasize the 
                    underground characteristics of a secret society where individuals 
                    vent their repressed desires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By dimming the illumination and turning off the ceiling lights, a strong 
                    sense of darkness is achieved. Additionally, we use neon lights to 
                    create a dual atmosphere of passion and existence within the dimness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A main light is installed at the top to accentuate the contours of 
                    the characters. Yellow lighting serves as supplementary lighting.
